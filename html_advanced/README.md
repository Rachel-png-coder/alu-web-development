The goal of this project is to implement a webpage from a designer file, focusing solely on the HTML structure. No CSS or styles will be applied in this phaseâ€”the emphasis is on creating a clean, semantic, and well-structured HTML document. This project is part of a series that aims to build advanced web development skills by progressively adding layers of functionality and design.

Implement Semantic HTML: Use semantic HTML5 elements to structure the webpage content appropriately.

Understand Designer Files: Learn how to interpret and translate Figma designs into HTML structures.

Adhere to Best Practices: Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.

Prepare for Styling: Lay the foundation for future projects where CSS and interactivity will be added.
